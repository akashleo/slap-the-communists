# ü§ù Contributing to Slap the Communists

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This guide will walk you through the process of adding new communist leaders to the application.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before contributing, please ensure you have:

- Basic knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript
- Git installed on your machine
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## üéØ How to Add a New Communist Leader

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slap-commies.git
cd slap-commies
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Prepare the Leader Image

1. **Find a high-quality image** of the communist leader
   - Recommended dimensions: At least 400x400 pixels
   - Preferred format: JPG or PNG
   - Ensure the image is in the public domain or you have rights to use it

2. **Optimize the image**:
   - Crop to a square aspect ratio if possible
   - Keep file size under 500KB for optimal performance
   - Use descriptive filename (e.g., `ho_chi_minh.jpg`)

3. **Add the image to the public folder**:
```bash
# Place your image in the public/ directory
public/your_leader_name.jpg
```

### Step 3: Add Leader Data

1. Open `src/data/leaders.ts`
2. Add a new leader object to the `leaders` array:

```typescript
{
  id: 'unique-leader-id',
  name: 'Leader Full Name',
  description: 'Comprehensive description of the leader, their role, achievements, and historical significance. Keep it informative and historically accurate.',
  imageUrl: '/your_image_filename.jpg',
  country: 'Country or Region',
  years: 'YYYY-YYYY'
}
```

### Step 4: Leader Data Requirements

#### Required Fields:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier (use lowercase, hyphen-separated format)
- **`name`**: Full name of the leader
- **`description`**: Detailed historical description (2-4 sentences)
- **`imageUrl`**: Path to image file (must start with `/`)
- **`country`**: Country or region they led
- **`years`**: Period of leadership or activity

#### Example Entry:

```typescript
{
  id: 'ho-chi-minh',
  name: 'Ho Chi Minh',
  description: 'Vietnamese revolutionary and statesman who served as Prime Minister and later President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He was a key figure in the foundation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945, as well as the People\'s Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.',
  imageUrl: '/ho_chi_minh.jpg',
  country: 'Vietnam',
  years: '1945-1969'
}
```

### Step 5: Validate Your Addition

1. **Check the Leader interface** in `src/types/Leader.ts` to ensure your data matches the expected structure

2. **Test locally**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Verify your leader appears**:
   - Navigate to the selection page
   - Confirm the image loads properly
   - Test the slapping functionality
   - Check responsiveness on different screen sizes
